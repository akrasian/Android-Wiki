Presentation Outline
--------------------

Introduction
> Each person introduces themselves
> Describe that the app is called UUiki and that it is designed for users of 
  Android devices to be able to create specialized wikis covering various topics
> Explain that a user can create and edit pages on a wiki, organize pages by
  category, link to other pages in the wiki, and search the contents of a wiki

Live Demo
> Launch the app to the main page
> Pick an existing wiki and show navigation through its pages
> Outline and demonstrate some of the features like categories, search, in-body
  hyperlinks, etc.
> Show a page edit and what can be changed
> Go back to home page and create a new project, walking through the process and
  showing what a freshly created project looks like

Postmortem
> Definitely discuss the major restructuring of pages from a list structure to a
  tree structure to allow for categorization as this was the largest redesign from
  the original concept to the finished project
> Also have to discuss our area of improvement chosen from the iteration 2
  retrospective (this is a manditory requirement)
> Pick one other topic to discuss about the project structure, scope, development
  process, etc. which should fill out the rest of our presentation time
> We should decide what these other 2 discussion topics will be ahead of time
